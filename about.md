I am an Engineer by passion and a Software Engineer by profession. I believe that creativity of a person is the answer to his/her everlasting search for satisfaction.

I am a very simple and down to earth guy, who likes the company of his family, and always gives them the highest priority. I am a growth minded student, who is always eager to learn and help others learn by sharing my knowledge and ideas. I also encourages up and coming Engineers to be pro-active and enjoy the process of building something new, that eventually will be making life easier for someone in some corner of the world.

I also blog quite often on [medium][my-medium-profile]
